# MNISTCNN: Simple CNN Classifier for the Digit Recognizer

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition. The competition involves classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of:
- **Train Dataset**: 42,000 examples of labeled handwritten digits (28x28 pixel grayscale images).
- **Test Dataset**: 28,000 unlabeled handwritten digit images for predictions.

### Loading Data
The training and test datasets are loaded as CSV files:
```python
train = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/digit-recognizer/train.csv")
test = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/digit-recognizer/test.csv")
```

## Model Overview
This project uses a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to classify the digits. The model is designed to:
1. Extract meaningful features from the images using convolutional layers.
2. Perform classification using dense layers.

The architecture and hyperparameters are kept simple for beginners to understand and experiment with.

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - TensorFlow/Keras

2. Load the training data and preprocess it.
3. Train the CNN model on the training data.
4. Use the trained model to predict the labels of the test dataset.

## Results
The trained CNN achieves a basic accuracy suitable for the introductory nature of this competition. Further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters, data augmentation, or using advanced architectures.

## Improvements
- Add data augmentation for better generalization.
- Experiment with deeper architectures like ResNet or Inception.
- Use learning rate schedulers or optimizers like AdamW.

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by Kaggle's introductory competition and uses the MNIST dataset.
